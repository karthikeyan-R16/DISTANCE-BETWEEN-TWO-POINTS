# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.

## ALGORITHM:
## step1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation

## Step 2:
Take two lists containing the points as the elemen

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two decimal places
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
a=[4,2]
b=[10,6]
dist=math.sqrt(((b[0]-a[0])**2)+((b[1]-a[1])**2))
print("%.2f"%dist)

```

### OUTPUT:
![python 3](https://github.com/karthikeyan-R16/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119421232/9ab20e5d-5759-4a63-b3b3-43f742d061ad)


### RESULT :

Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using pythonÂ programming
