# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
## step1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation

## Step 2:
Take two lists containing the points as the elemen

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two decimal places
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
![python 3](https://github.com/karthikeyan-R16/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119421232/9ab20e5d-5759-4a63-b3b3-43f742d061ad)


### RESULT:
Thus the program to distance between two points is executed successfully.
