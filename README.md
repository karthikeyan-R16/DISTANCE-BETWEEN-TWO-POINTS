# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.

## ALGORITHM:
## step1: Import numpy module to use built-in functions
## Step 2: Get lists from the linear equations and assign it to np.array
## Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula
## Step 4: Print the result.
## Step 5: End the program.


### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: Karthikeyan R
#RegisterNumber: 212222240045
import math
d1=[4,2]
d2=[10,6]
dist=math.sqrt(((d2[0]-d1[0])**2)+((d2[1]-d1[1])**2))
print("%.2f"%dist)

```

### OUTPUT:
![python 3](https://github.com/karthikeyan-R16/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119421232/9ab20e5d-5759-4a63-b3b3-43f742d061ad)


### RESULT :

Thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using pythonÂ programming
